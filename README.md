# Resume project

This is a personal project that I have created for two reasons:

- Maybe having someday a resume I feel like using (in the meantime, this project itself can serve as a testimonial of my Angular proficiency)
- Create a playground to experiement with (this is the frontend code, but it works with a serverless backend and some cloud services)
